'''# Dimension Reduction - PCA - In supervised learning (predictive modeling), within regression we have collinearity problem. 
# This can be addressed using PCA. PCs which are the end result of PCA application would be uncorrelated.

# CRISP-ML(Q):
    Business & Data Understanding:
        Business Problem: Huge number of features to analyze requires a lot of compute and is time consuming
        Business Objective: Minimize the compute & time for processing
        Business Constraints: Minimize the features deletion
        
        Success Criteria:
            Business: Reduce the compute required by 50%
            ML: Get at least 50% compression
            Economic: ROI of at least $500K over a period of 1 year
